I understand that you've provided the current code for your PDF Tables to CSV app. This application is designed to extract tables from PDF files and save them as CSV files. Here's an overview of how the app works based on the provided code:

## Application Structure

The application follows a modular structure with clear separation of concerns:

1. **Main Entry Point**: `src/main.py` serves as the entry point, initializing logging and launching the user interface.

2. **User Interface**: `src/user_interface/main_window.py` contains the `PDFExtractorUI` class, which sets up the main window with buttons for selecting PDFs and closing the app.

3. **PDF Processing**: `src/controllers/pdf_manager.py` orchestrates the PDF processing workflow, delegating tasks to specialized modules.

4. **PDF Modules**: Located in `src/controllers/pdf_modules/`, these handle specific tasks such as selecting PDFs, extracting tables, displaying tables, and saving to CSV.

5. **Configuration**: `src/configs/` contains constants and path configurations for the application.

6. **Utilities**: `src/utils/custom_logging/` provides custom logging functionality.

## Workflow

The application follows this general workflow:

1. User selects a PDF file.
2. Tables are extracted from the PDF.
3. Extracted tables are displayed for user selection.
4. Selected tables are saved to a CSV file.

## Code Structure and Principles

The code adheres to several good practices:

1. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**: Each module and class has a specific, well-defined responsibility.

2. **Separation of Concerns (SoC)**: The UI, PDF processing, and utility functions are separated into distinct modules.

3. **Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)**: Common functionality is encapsulated in reusable functions and classes.

4. **PEP 8**: The code generally follows PEP 8 style guidelines for Python code.

## Suggestions for Current Code

1. **Error Handling**: Consider implementing more robust error handling, especially in the PDF processing modules.

2. **Type Hinting**: While type hints are used in some places, they could be more consistently applied throughout the codebase.

3. **Documentation**: Some functions and classes could benefit from more detailed docstrings, especially explaining the purpose and usage of each module.

4. **Configuration**: Consider using a configuration file (e.g., YAML or JSON) for application settings instead of hardcoding them in Python files.

5. **Logging**: The custom logging setup is good, but ensure it's being used consistently across all modules.

6. **Testing**: There's a `tests` directory, but no test files are visible. Implementing unit tests would improve code reliability.

7. **User Feedback**: Consider adding more user feedback mechanisms, such as progress bars for long-running operations.

These suggestions aim to enhance the existing codebase without adding new features, focusing on improving code quality, maintainability, and user experience.
